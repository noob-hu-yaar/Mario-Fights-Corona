I have created this game using basic Javascript and HTML.


As soon as opening the game,this is what the page looks like-

We notice the score board showing a score of 0 at the beginning.

Upon further advancing Mario towards the gem, we see an increase in the score board

The page shows GAME OVER, once we collide with the coronavirus particles.

And if we manage to reach the gem at the end,VOILA!!...We win the game,and the score appears.
